# Bastion Browser

A private, ephemeral web browser for Linux. No history, no disk writes, Tor by default.

Built on WebKitGTK because writing a browser engine from scratch is insane and I'm not that bored.

---

## What it actually does

- **No history.** Not "private mode" — there's no history recording anywhere in the code. It's not a toggle.
- **No disk writes during browsing.** Cookies, cache, session data all live in RAM and vanish when you close the browser. Bookmarks are the one exception (opt-in, off with one click).
- **Routes through Tor by default.** SOCKS5 on `127.0.0.1:9050`. I2P, direct, custom SOCKS5, and Tor-over-SOCKS5 chains all work too.
- **DNS over HTTPS with DNSSEC.** dnscrypt-proxy handles all DNS, nothing leaks in cleartext.
- **400+ tracker domains blocked** via WebKit's native content blocker.
- **Canvas, WebGL, AudioContext, and Navigator fingerprinting all spoofed.** Every page loads with a script that poisons the fingerprinting surface before any other JS runs.
- **WebRTC can't leak your IP.** Patched to force relay-only with empty ICE servers.
- **Tracking params stripped** from every URL — `utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, `msclkid`, the whole family.
- **HTTPS-only.** Plain HTTP gets auto-upgraded. TLS errors hard-block with no "proceed anyway" button.
- **Hardened binary.** PIE, full RELRO, stack canaries, Intel CET, `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`.

## Install

### Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro / EndeavourOS

```bash
unzip bastion-browser.zip
cd bastion-browser
chmod +x installarch.sh
./installarch.sh
```

### Debian / Ubuntu / Mint / Pop!_OS

```bash
unzip bastion-browser.zip
cd bastion-browser
chmod +x installdeb.sh
./installdeb.sh
```

The install script installs build deps, sets up Tor and dnscrypt-proxy, applies some kernel sysctl hardening, compiles the browser, and drops the binary in `/usr/local/bin/bastion`. You'll get prompted for sudo once.

macOS and Windows aren't supported and probably never will be — the whole thing is built on GTK.

## Usage

```bash
bastion                          # Tor (default)
bastion --proxy=i2p              # I2P
bastion --proxy=none             # direct, no anonymization
bastion --proxy=socks5://host:port
bastion --proxy=chain://host:port  # Tor → SOCKS5 chain
```

### Internal pages

- `bastion://home` — search, bookmarks, session stats
- `bastion://bookmarks`
- `bastion://downloads`
- `bastion://settings` — theme, search engine, privacy toggles

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Ctrl+T | New tab |
| Ctrl+W | Close tab |
| Ctrl+L | Focus address bar |
| Ctrl+F | Find in page |
| Ctrl+D | Toggle bookmark |
| Ctrl+J | Downloads |
| Ctrl+, | Settings |
| Ctrl++ / Ctrl+- | Zoom |
| Ctrl+0 | Reset zoom |
| F5 | Reload |
| Alt+← / Alt+→ | Back / Forward |

## Themes

Three, switchable live in settings:

- **Modern Dark** (default)
- **Modern Light**
- **Retro Windows Vista Aero** — because sometimes you just want glossy blue gradients in your life

---

## Search engines

- DuckDuckGo (default)
- Brave Search
- Startpage
- SearXNG (via searx.be)

No Google. Swap in Settings.

Build system is CMake + Ninja. Deps: GTK3, WebKitGTK 4.1, libsoup3, glib2, pango. Nothing exotic.

## What it doesn't do

I want to be upfront about this:

- **It's not magic.** If you log into your Google account through Tor, Google still knows who you are. Tor hides your IP, not your identity when you hand it over.
- **It's not a Tor Browser replacement.** Tor Browser does more — like blocking JS entirely in "Safest" mode, shipping a fixed window size to defeat viewport fingerprinting, and rotating circuits per-tab. Bastion is a privacy-hardened general-purpose browser, not an anonymity tool for threat models that require real OPSEC.
- **It's session-only by design.** Close it and your tabs are gone. If you want session restore, use a different browser.
- **It doesn't sync anywhere.** No account, no cloud. If you want your bookmarks on another machine, copy `~/.config/bastion/state.txt` across.
- **It's built on WebKitGTK**, which isn't Chrome or Firefox. Some sites will look slightly off. Most won't.

---

## Problems

If the build fails, paste the full error somewhere and I'll probably tell you what's wrong. Common ones:

- **`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev` not found on Ubuntu < 22.04** — your distro is too old, WebKitGTK 4.1 requires a recent release.
- **Tor connection times out** — give it 30 seconds after `systemctl start tor` to bootstrap. Check with `curl --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:9050 https://check.torproject.org/api/ip`.
- **dnscrypt-proxy won't start** — it fights with systemd-resolved for port 53. The install script handles this on most distros but edge cases exist.
